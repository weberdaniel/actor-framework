# What is CAF?

CAF is an open source framework that offers a programming environment based on
the [Actor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) of computation
combined with a [scalable](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2541329.2541336),
[native](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477842416000038)
runtime environment that lets you build applications at a high level of
abstraction without sacrificing performance. Whether you are targeting a single
machine, a data center, or the cloud, CAF provides the necessary tools to
implement robust, scalable, and maintainable software.

CAF features lightweight & fast actor implementations, data flows, HTTP and
WebSocket support, pattern matching for messages, metrics, distributed actors,
and more. Professional support, training, and consulting are available from
[Interance](https://www.interance.io), the company behind CAF.

## Get CAF

We do not officially maintain packages for CAF. However, some of our community
members made packages available for these package managers:

- [Conan](https://conan.io/center/caf)
- [FreeBSD Ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/devel/caf)
- [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/caf).
- [VCPKG](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/caf)

## Get the Sources

```sh
git clone https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework.git
cd actor-framework
```

## Build CAF from Source

CAF uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) as its build system of choice. To make
building CAF more convenient from the command line, we provide a `configure`
script that wraps the CMake invocation. The script only works on UNIX systems.
On Windows, we recommend generating an MSVC project file via CMake for native
builds.

### Using the `configure` Script

The script is a convenient frontend for `CMake`. See `configure -h` for a list
of available options. By default, the script creates a `build` directory and
asks CMake to generate a `Makefile`. A build with default settings generally
follows these steps:

```sh
./configure
cd build
make
make test [optional]
make install [as root, optional]
```

### Using CMake

To generate a Makefile for building CAF with default settings, either use a
CMake GUI or perform this step on the command line:

```sh
cmake -S <path-to-caf-sources> -B build
```

After this step, `cmake -LH` prints the most useful configuration options for
CAF, their default value, and a helptext.

Other CMake projects can add CAF as a dependency by using `find_package` and
listing the required modules (e.g., `core` or `net`) . When installing CAF to a
non-standard location, set `CAF_ROOT` prior to calling `find_package`.

## Dependencies

* CMake (for building CAF)
* OpenSSL (when building the `openssl` or `net` module)

## Supported Platforms

C++ is an evolving language. Compiler vendors constantly add more language and
standard library features. Since CAF runs on many platforms, this means we need
a policy that on the one hand ensures that we only use a widely supported subset
of C++ and on the other hand that we naturally progress with the shifting
landscape to eventually catch up to more recent C++ additions (in order to not
"get stuck").

So instead of singling out individual compiler versions, we build CAF for each
commit on all platforms that we currently deem relevant. Everything that passes
our CI is "fair game".

Our CI covers Windows (latest MSVC release), macOS (latest Xcode release),
FreeBSD (latest) and several Linux distributions (via the Docker images found
[here](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework/tree/main/.ci)). For
Linux, we aim to support the current releases (that still receive active
support) for the major distributions. Note that we do not build on Linux
distributions with rolling releases, because they generally provide more recent
build tools than distributions with traditional release schedules and thus would
only add redundancy.

## Build Documentation Locally

- Building an offline version of the manual requires
  [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org):
  ```sh
  cd manual
  sphinx-build . html
  ```
- Building an offline version of the API reference documentation requires
  [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl) (simply run the  `doxygen` command at the
  root directory of the repository).
